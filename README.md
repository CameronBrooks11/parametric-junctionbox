Generate your own junction boxes - the exact size and thickness you need, with the right number of cable entries.

Parametric junction box for electric wiring. Use the default 100mm x 100mm x 50mm (8 holes sized for M20 cable glands) STLs supplied, or adjust the OpenSCAD file to control dimensions, number of holes, cable gland diameter and so on. Make the exact junction box you need! Lid screws down with M3x12 (or thereabouts) self-tapping screws. If your cable glands are too big for your cable, generate bushings for a nice snug fit! Too many holes? No problem, use the friction-fit blocker. Please note that this junction box is not likely to be watertight as printed, but may be with a bead of silicone on the lip of the box before closing the lid. You might need to increase number of walls relative to your normal settings to get to a watertight print.
